# MalignantMistTwine
This repository is for an interactive narrative project that I created with Twine (https://twinery.org/). Read my artist's statement, credits and more below on the README.

Artist Statement:

Malignant Mist is an interactive text-based horror, seeking to elevate the stressful impact of choices a player must make under pressure of an unavoidable threat. 

The player embodies 23-year-old Frankie Williams, who will need to use their wits to outlast a deadly mist both infectious and dangerously cold surrounding the van.

The suspenseful sound effects throughout the game will keep the player on edge, immersed in a world where a mutation of a natural phenomenon fights back against humankind. 

Because the wrong choice can lead to death, the player is encouraged to continue from their last selection and learn from their mistakes. 

Utilizing Twine's ability to use audio and timed text helped me understand how I could the tools provided to create an interactive narrative that I hope can spook the player.
